ðŸŒŠ Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting & Social Media Analytics

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Indiaâ€™s 7,500 km long coastline is highly vulnerable to ocean-related hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, swell events, and abnormal sea behavior. While agencies like INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services) provide official alerts based on satellite and model data, there is a gap in real-time ground reporting from citizens and communities.

This project proposes an integrated mobile + web platform that combines:

Crowdsourced hazard reports (photos, videos, geotags from citizens).

Social media analytics (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook posts analyzed with NLP).

Interactive dashboards for disaster managers.

The goal is to create a two-way communication system that complements existing government alert systems (like SACHET App) and improves situational awareness, response speed, and coastal resilience.
